Stay home as much as possible and avoid close contact with others. Wear a cloth face covering that covers your nose and mouth in public settings. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcoholbased hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.</p>
            <p>Buy groceries and medicine,go to the doctor, and complete banking activities online when possible. If you must go in person, stay at least 6 feet away from others and disinfect items you must touch. Get deliveries and takeout, and limit in-person contact as much as possible. Stay home if you are sick, except to get medical care. Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis. Separate yourself from other people and pets in your home. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19, but you can seek medical care to help relieve your symptoms. If you need medical attention, call ahead.</p>
